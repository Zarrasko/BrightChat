/**
 * Temporarily lifts LightOS's forced grayscale — vandamd's zero-camera trick.
 * The Light Phone's B&W look is just Android's accessibility color-correction
 * (daltonizer) pinned to grayscale, a secure setting; flipping
 * `accessibility_display_daltonizer_enabled` off shows true color instantly
 * (it's a SurfaceFlinger color-matrix change, no restart).
 *
 * Writing it needs `WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS`, grantable only over adb (one-time):
 *
 *     adb shell pm grant com.craigeley.chat android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS
 *
 * Without the grant every call here no-ops (the SecurityException is swallowed)
 * and the viewer simply stays grayscale like the rest of the phone.
 *
 * [acquire]/[release] bracket the full-screen image viewer's lifetime; the
 * [onAppHidden]/[onAppVisible] pair (MainActivity.onStop/onStart) restores
 * grayscale while the user is elsewhere on the phone and re-lifts it if they
 * come back with the viewer still open. `held` survives that stop/start;
 * nothing is persisted — a process death mid-view can leave the phone in color
 * until the app next runs (same gap zero accepts).
